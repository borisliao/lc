    Let's break down the code and its logic in more detail:

    1. `std::unordered_map<int, std::pair<int, int>> mp;`

    - `mp` is an unordered map used to store intervals (ranges) of consecutive numbers. Each key represents the right endpoint of an interval, and the corresponding value is a pair `(r, l)` where `r` is the right endpoint and `l` is the left endpoint of the interval.

    2. `std::unordered_map<int, bool> bl;`

    - `bl` is an unordered map used to keep track of whether an element `i` has been visited. If an element has been visited, its corresponding value in this map will be `true;` otherwise, it will be `false.`

    3. `int mx = 0;`

    - `mx` is a variable that keeps track of the maximum length of consecutive sequence found.

    4. The main loop iterates through each element `i` in the input `nums` array.  
        Inside the loop:

        a. `if (bl[i]) { continue; }`  
            If the current element `i` has already been visited, skip it and continue to the next iteration of the loop.  

        b. `bl[i] = true;`  
            Mark the current element `i` as visited by setting its corresponding value in the `bl` map to `true`.  

        c. Initialize `l` and `r` to the current element `i`, representing the left and right endpoints of the current interval.

        d. Check if there is an interval with the right endpoint `i + 1` in the `mp` map using `mp.find(i + 1)`. If such an interval exists, update the right endpoint `r` to the right endpoint of that interval.

        e. Similarly, check if there is an interval with the right endpoint `i - 1` in the `mp` map using `mp.find(i - 1)`. If such an interval exists, update the left endpoint `l` to the left endpoint of that interval.  

        f. Update the `mp` map:  
            Set `mp[r]` to a pair `(r, l)`, indicating the interval with right endpoint `r` and left endpoint l.  
            Set `mp[l]` to the same pair `(r, l)`.  

        g. Calculate the length of the current consecutive sequence as `r - l + 1` and update the maximum length `mx` if this length is greater than the current maximum.

    5. Finally, return the maximum length mx, which represents the length of the longest consecutive sequence found in the input array.
